# Snake game
This is a small project done during one weekend in the summer of 2021. 
The project uses mainly just plain javascript with some CSS and HTML additions. 
It is a one-page web application where the user can play the classic snake game. The snake can be moved using WASD, and the snake grows longer every time it eats fruit.
